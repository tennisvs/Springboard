    "January 2014. The data was pulled several months later; we consider a user retained if they were “active” (i.e. took a trip) in the preceding 30 days. We would like you to use this data set to help understand what factors are the best predictors for retention, and offer suggestions to operationalize those insights to help Ultimate. The data is in the attached file ultimate_data_challenge.json. See below for a detailed description of the dataset. Please include any code you wrote for the analysis and delete the dataset when you have finished with the challenge.\n",
